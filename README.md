# WhatDoesThisFuncDo

This is another attempt to push ML wherever you can :)

Yhis project is designed to explore func's behavior using only their low-level code.

Its purpose: to answer  **what does this func do?**


# Observe the repo

The repo consist of several part: data and data preparation instruments, data visualisation, some standart ML algorithms implementatin and DL algorithmsa, trained on existed data neuralnetwork (prepared to use).

You can use the already existed data or add new and train then you own network.

# Func's classes

I use that classes of funcs:

* String and text processing
* Networking
* Containers
* Algorithms
* Programming
* Math and numerics
* Data structures
* System

## Steps

* get or add the data: in progress...
* data preparation: soon
*
